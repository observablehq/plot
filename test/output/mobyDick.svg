    <text transform="translate(0,0)"><tspan x="0" y="0.852em">Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">the same feelings towards the ocean with me.</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="2.4em">There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="2.4em">Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles;</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">fields gone? What do they here?</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="2.4em">But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice. No. They</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. And there</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">they stand—miles of them—leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys,</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">streets and avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me,</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">them thither?</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="2.4em">Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take almost</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most absent-minded of</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">men be plunged in his deepest reveries—stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region.</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="2.4em">But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest,</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco. What is the</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">in their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd’s head, yet all were</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">vain, unless the shepherd’s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">among Tiger-lilies—what is the one charm wanting?—Water—there is not a drop of</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning.</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could not</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="2.4em">Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean to</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a passenger you</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it.</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">Besides, passengers get sea-sick—grow quarrelsome—don’t sleep of nights—do not</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;—no, I never go as a passenger; nor,</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain,</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">them. For my part, I abominate all honorable respectable toils, trials, and</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not.</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">And as for going as cook,—though I confess there is considerable glory in that, a</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">cook being a sort of officer on ship-board—yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">fowls;—though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the mummies</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="2.4em">No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumb down</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True, they rather order me</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one’s</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">sense of honor, particularly if you come of an old established family in the land,</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if just</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. The transition</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">is a keen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">wears off in time.</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="2.4em">What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and sweep</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in the</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">the less of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">particular instance? Who ain’t a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">sea-captains may order me about—however they may thump and punch me about, I</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one way</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">or other served in much the same way—either in a physical or metaphysical point of</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">each other’s shoulder-blades, and be content.</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="2.4em">Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying me for</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must pay. And there is all the</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">difference in the world between paying and being paid. The act of paying is</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">upon us. But being paid,—what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">a man receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no account can a</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="2.4em">Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise and pure</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world, head winds are far more prevalent</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">than winds from astern (that is, if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">the most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">hand from the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not so. In</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things, at</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But wherefore it was that after</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">head to go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">some unaccountable way—he can better answer than any one else. And, doubtless,</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand programme of</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as a sort of brief</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">interlude and solo between more extensive performances. I take it that this part of</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">the bill must have run something like this:</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="2.4em">“Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States. “WHALING</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. “BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.”</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="2.4em">Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the Fates, put</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others were set down for</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel comedies,</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">and jolly parts in farces—though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me to set</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment.</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="2.4em">Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself.</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity. Then the wild</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">of the whale; these, with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">could still be social with it—would they let me—since it is but well to be on friendly</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in.</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="2.4em">By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the great flood-</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild conceits that swayed me</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">to my purpose, two and two there floated into my inmost soul, endless</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">processions of the whale, and, mid most of them all, one grand hooded phantom,</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="1.2em">like a snow hill in the air.</tspan></text>
