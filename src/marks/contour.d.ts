 * Returns a new contour mark, which creates contour polygons from spatial
 * samples. If *data* is provided, it represents discrete samples in abstract
 * coordinates **x** and **y**; the **value** channel specifies further abstract
 * values (_e.g._, height in a topographic map) to be spatially interpolated to
 * produce a raster grid of quantitative values (like in the raster mark), and
 * lastly contours via marching squares, which are rendered as vector polygons.
 * For example, to generate filled contours from a topographic map, where the
 * color corresponds to the contour threshold value:
 *
 * ```js
 * Plot.contour(volcano.values, {width: volcano.width, height: volcano.height, fill: Plot.identity})
 * ```
 *
 * The **fill** and **fillOpacity** channels may alternatively be specified as
 * functions *f*(*x*, *y*) to be evaluated at each pixel centroid of the
 * underlying raster grid (without interpolation). For example, to draw a
 * contour plot of a two-dimensional function:
 *
 * ```js
 * Plot.contour({x1: -1, x2: 1, y1: -1, y2: 1, fill: (x, y) => Math.atan2(y, x)})
 * ```
 *
 * With the exception of the **x**, **y**, and **value** channels, the contour
 * markâ€™s channels are not evaluated on the initial *data* but rather on the
 * generated contour multipolygons.
