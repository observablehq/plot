## Staying up-to-date

Please star ‚≠êÔ∏è our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/observablehq/plot) to show your support for us on GitHub!

Plot is getting better all the time; catch up on [recent releases](https://github.com/observablehq/plot/releases) by reading our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/observablehq/plot/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

And of course, follow us on [Observable](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq?tab=profile), [Mastodon](https://vis.social/@observablehq), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/observablehq), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/observable)!

## Getting help

We recommend asking for help on the [Observable forum](https://talk.observablehq.com/c/help/6). Or if you prefer chat, join the [Observable community Slack](https://observablehq.com/slack/join).

We encourage you to share your work, no matter how messy, on [Observable](https://observablehq.com). Sharing live code is the easiest way to let people see what you see, and to debug your problem. Strive for a [minimal, reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) ‚Äî¬†it helps people hone in on your problem more quickly.

When asking for help, don‚Äôt just post your code and ask people to fix it. Provide context, and say what you want help with. For example:

- What are you trying to achieve? What is your goal?
- What other solutions have you tried?
- What behavior are you currently seeing?
- Is the current behavior not what you expect?

If you think you‚Äôve found a bug in Plot, please file a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/observablehq/plot/issues). But don‚Äôt use an issue to ask for help ‚Äî¬†you‚Äôll have better luck on the forum or Slack.

## Getting involved

We‚Äôd love for you to join the community! Here are some ways to participate:

* Share your work on [Observable](https://observablehq.com). Working in public is a great way to help others learn and be inspired. Don‚Äôt worry if your code is messy or unfinished; sharing drafts normalizes the challenges that everyone experiences doing data visualization.

* Upvote üëç or comment on [GitHub issues](https://github.com/observablehq/plot/issues). We‚Äôd love your input on what to build next. If your desired feature isn‚Äôt already there, or if you‚Äôve found a bug, file an issue and tell us about it.

* Answer questions or participate in discussions on the [Observable forum](https://talk.observablehq.com/) and the [Observable community Slack](https://observablehq.com/slack/join). You‚Äôll help others, and might learn something yourself, too.

* Open a pull request! Read our [guide to contributing](https://github.com/observablehq/plot/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Please help us maintain a positive environment for all by adhering to our [code of conduct](https://github.com/observablehq/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Thank you!
