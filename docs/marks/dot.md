# Dot mark

The **dot mark** draws circles or other symbols positioned in **x** and **y** as in a scatterplot. For example, the scatterplot below shows the roughly-inverse relationship in a dataset of cars between power (in horsepower) in *y*↑ and fuel efficiency (in miles per gallon) in *x*→.

:::plot
```js
Plot.plot({
  grid: true,
  marks: [
    Plot.dot(cars, {x: "economy (mpg)", y: "power (hp)"})
  ]
})
```
:::

Using a functional definition of **x**, we can instead plot the roughly-linear relationship when fuel efficiency is represented as gallons per 100 miles, similar to the liters per 100 km metric used in countries that have adopted the metric system.

:::plot
```js
Plot.plot({
  grid: true,
  inset: 10,
  x: {label: "Fuel consumption (gallons per 100 miles) →"},
  y: {label: "↑ Horsepower"},
  marks: [
    Plot.dot(cars, {
      x: (d) => 100 / (d["economy (mpg)"] ?? NaN),
      y: "power (hp)"
    })
  ]
})
```
:::

:::info
This data contains nulls; nullish coalescing (`??`) to NaN prevents coercion to zero.
:::

Dots support **stroke** and **fill** channels in addition to position along **x** and **y**. Below, color is used as a redundant encoding to emphasize the rising trend in average global surface temperatures. A *diverging* color scale assigns values below zero blue and above zero red.

:::plot defer
```js
Plot.plot({
  y: {
    grid: true,
    tickFormat: "+f",
    label: "↑ Surface temperature anomaly (°F)"
  },
  color: {
    scheme: "BuRd"
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.ruleY([0]),
    Plot.dot(gistemp, {x: "Date", y: "Anomaly", stroke: "Anomaly"})
  ]
})
```
:::

Dots also support an **r** channel allowing the size of dots to represent data. Below, each dot represents a trading day; the *x*-position represents the day’s change, while the *y*-position and area (**r**) represent the day’s trading volume. As you might expect, days with higher volatility have higher trading volume.

:::plot defer
```js
Plot.plot({
  grid: true,
  x: {
    label: "Daily change (%) →",
    tickFormat: "+f",
    percent: true
  },
  y: {
    type: "log",
    label: "↑ Daily trading volume"
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.ruleX([0]),
    Plot.dot(aapl, {x: (d) => (d.Close - d.Open) / d.Open, y: "Volume", r: "Volume"})
  ]
})
```
:::

With the [bin transform](../transforms/bin.md), sized dots can also be used as an alternative to a [rect-based](./rect.md) heatmap to show a two-dimensional distribution.

:::plot defer
```js
Plot.plot({
  height: 640,
  grid: true,
  x: {
    label: "Carats →"
  },
  y: {
    label: "↑ Price ($)"
  },
  r: {
    range: [0, 20]
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.dot(diamonds, Plot.bin({r: "count"}, {x: "carat", y: "price", thresholds: 100}))
  ]
})
```
:::

While dots are typically positioned in two dimensions (**x** and **y**), one-dimensional dots (only **x** or only **y**) are also supported. Below, dot area is used to represent the frequency of letters in the English language as a compact alternative to a bar chart.

:::plot
```js
Plot.dot(alphabet, {x: "letter", r: "frequency"}).plot()
```
:::

Dots, together with [rules](./rule.md), can be used as a stylistic alternative to [bars](./bar.md) to produce a lollipop 🍭 chart. (Sadly they cannot be eaten.)

:::plot
```js
Plot.plot({
  x: {label: null, tickPadding: 6, tickSize: 0},
  y: {percent: true},
  marks: [
    Plot.ruleX(alphabet, {x: "letter", y: "frequency", strokeWidth: 2}),
    Plot.dot(alphabet, {x: "letter", y: "frequency", fill: "currentColor", r: 4})
  ]
})
```
:::

Sometimes, a scatterplot may have an ordinal dimension on either *x* and *y*, as in the plot below comparing the demographics of states: color represents age group, and *x* represents the proportion of the state’s population in that age group. A *reduce* transform is used to pull out the minimum and maximum values for each state such that a rule can span the extent for better Gestalt grouping.

:::plot defer
```js
Plot.plot({
  height: 660,
  axis: null,
  grid: true,
  x: {
    axis: "top",
    label: "Percent (%) →",
    percent: true
  },
  color: {
    scheme: "spectral",
    domain: stateage.ages, // in order
    legend: true
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.ruleX([0]),
    Plot.ruleY(stateage, Plot.groupY({x1: "min", x2: "max"}, {...xy, sort: {y: "x1"}})),
    Plot.dot(stateage, {...xy, fill: "age", title: "age"}),
    Plot.text(stateage, Plot.selectMinX({...xy, textAnchor: "end", dx: -6, text: "state"}))
  ]
})
```
:::

```js
xy = Plot.normalizeX({basis: "sum", z: "state", x: "population", y: "state"})
```

As another example of a scatterplot with an ordinal dimension, we can plot age groups along the *x*-axis and connect states with lines. This emphasizes the overall age distribution of the United States, while giving a hint to variation across states.

```js
{
  const xy = Plot.normalizeY({basis: "sum", z: "state", x: "age", y: "population"});
  return Plot.plot({
    grid: true,
    x: {
      domain: stateage.ages, // in order
      label: "Age range (years) →",
      labelAnchor: "right"
    },
    y: {
      label: "↑ Percent of population (%)",
      transform: (d) => d * 100
    },
    marks: [
      Plot.ruleY([0]),
      Plot.line(stateage, {...xy, strokeWidth: 1, stroke: "#ccc"}),
      Plot.dot(stateage, xy)
    ]
  });
}
```

Another visualization technique supported by the dot mark is the [quantile-quantile (QQ) plot](https://observablehq.com/d/6bb4330bca6eba2b); this is used to compare univariate two distributions.

## Dot options

In addition to the [standard mark options](#marks), the following optional channels are supported:

* **x** - the horizontal position; bound to the *x* scale
* **y** - the vertical position; bound to the *y* scale
* **r** - the radius (area); bound to the *radius* scale, which defaults to *sqrt*
* **rotate** - the rotation angle in degrees clockwise
* **symbol** - the categorical symbol; bound to the *symbol* scale

If either of the **x** or **y** channels are not specified, the corresponding position is controlled by the **frameAnchor** option.

The following dot-specific constant options are also supported:

* **r** - the effective radius (length); a number in pixels
* **rotate** - the rotation angle in degrees clockwise; defaults to 0
* **symbol** - the categorical symbol; defaults to circle
* **frameAnchor** - the [frame anchor](#frameanchor); defaults to *middle*

The **r** option can be specified as either a channel or constant. When the radius is specified as a number, it is interpreted as a constant; otherwise it is interpreted as a channel. The radius defaults to 4.5 pixels when using the **symbol** channel, and otherwise 3 pixels. Dots with a nonpositive radius are not drawn.

The **stroke** defaults to none. The **fill** defaults to currentColor if the stroke is none, and to none otherwise. The **strokeWidth** defaults to 1.5. The **rotate** and **symbol** options can be specified as either channels or constants. When rotate is specified as a number, it is interpreted as a constant; otherwise it is interpreted as a channel. When symbol is a valid symbol name or symbol object (implementing the draw method), it is interpreted as a constant; otherwise it is interpreted as a channel. If the **symbol** channel’s values are all symbols, symbol names, or nullish, the channel is unscaled (values are interpreted literally); otherwise, the channel is bound to the *symbol* scale.

The built-in **symbol** types are: *circle*, *cross*, *diamond*, *square*, *star*, *triangle*, and *wye* (for fill) and *circle*, *plus*, *times*, *triangle2*, *asterisk*, *square2*, and *diamond2* (for stroke, based on [Heman Robinson’s research](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10618600.2019.1637746)). The *hexagon* symbol is also supported. You can also specify a D3 or custom symbol type as an object that implements the [*symbol*.draw(*context*, *size*)](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/main/README.md#custom-symbol-types) method.

Dots are sorted by descending radius by default to mitigate overplotting; set the **sort** option to null to draw them in input order.

## dot(*data*, *options*)

```js
Plot.dot(sales, {x: "units", y: "fruit"})
```

Returns a new dot with the given *data* and *options*. If neither the **x** nor **y** nor **frameAnchor** options are specified, *data* is assumed to be an array of pairs [[*x₀*, *y₀*], [*x₁*, *y₁*], [*x₂*, *y₂*], …] such that **x** = [*x₀*, *x₁*, *x₂*, …] and **y** = [*y₀*, *y₁*, *y₂*, …].

## dotX(*data*, *options*)

```js
Plot.dotX(cars.map((d) => d["economy (mpg)"]))
```

Equivalent to [Plot.dot](#plotdotdata-options) except that if the **x** option is not specified, it defaults to the identity function and assumes that *data* = [*x₀*, *x₁*, *x₂*, …].

If an **interval** is specified, such as d3.utcDay, **y** is transformed to (*interval*.floor(*y*) + *interval*.offset(*interval*.floor(*y*))) / 2. If the interval is specified as a number *n*, *y* will be the midpoint of two consecutive multiples of *n* that bracket *y*.

## dotY(*data*, *options*)

```js
Plot.dotY(cars.map((d) => d["economy (mpg)"]))
```

Equivalent to [Plot.dot](#plotdotdata-options) except that if the **y** option is not specified, it defaults to the identity function and assumes that *data* = [*y₀*, *y₁*, *y₂*, …].

If an **interval** is specified, such as d3.utcDay, **x** is transformed to (*interval*.floor(*x*) + *interval*.offset(*interval*.floor(*x*))) / 2. If the interval is specified as a number *n*, *x* will be the midpoint of two consecutive multiples of *n* that bracket *x*.

## circle(*data*, *options*)

Equivalent to [Plot.dot](#plotdotdata-options) except that the **symbol** option is set to *circle*.

## hexagon(*data*, *options*)

Equivalent to [Plot.dot](#plotdotdata-options) except that the **symbol** option is set to *hexagon*.
