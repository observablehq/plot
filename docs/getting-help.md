# Getting help

Here are some tips on getting help!

Create a [minimal, reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) of whatever trouble you’re having. The smaller, the better—it helps people hone in on your problem more quickly.

Share it as an [Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com). It’s almost impossible to debug a problem without being able to run, or even see, the full code!

Post your question to the [Observable forum](https://talk.observablehq.com/c/help/6) or [Observable Slack](https://observable-community.slack.com/ssb/redirect). Try to provide context: What are you trying to do? What behavior are you currently seeing? How is that different from you expected? What other things have you tried? Don’t ask people to do your work for you.

If you think you’ve found a bug, you can file a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/observablehq/plot/issues). But don’t use an issue to ask for help—that’s what the community help forum is for!
