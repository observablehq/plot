# What is Plot?

**Observable Plot** is a free, open-source, JavaScript library for visualizing tabular data, focused on accelerating exploratory data analysis. It has a concise, memorable, yet expressive API, featuring [scales](./features/scales.md) and [layered marks](./features/marks.md) in the grammar of graphics style. And there are [plenty of examples](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-gallery) to learn from and copy-paste.

In the spirit of *show don’t tell*, here’s a scatterplot of body measurements of athletes from the [2016 Summer Olympics](https://flother.is/2017/olympic-games-data/).

:::plot defer https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-olympians-scatterplot
```js
Plot
  .dot(olympians, {x: "weight", y: "height", stroke: "sex"})
  .plot({color: {legend: true}})
```
:::

A plot specification assigns columns of data (*weight*, *height*, and *sex*) to visual properties of marks (**x**, **y**, and **stroke**). Plot does the rest! You can configure much more, if needed, but Plot’s goal is to help you get a meaningful visualization quickly to accelerate analysis.

This scatterplot suffers from overplotting: many dots are drawn in the same spot, so it’s hard to perceive density. We can fix this by applying a [bin transform](./transforms/bin.md) to group athletes of similar height and weight (and sex), and then use opacity to encode the number of athletes in the bin.

:::plot defer https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-olympians-bins
```js
Plot.rect(olympians, Plot.bin({fillOpacity: "count"}, {x: "weight", y: "height", fill: "sex", inset: 0})).plot()
```
:::

Or we could try the [density mark](./marks/density.md).

:::plot defer https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-olympians-density
```js
Plot.density(olympians, {x: "weight", y: "height", stroke: "sex"}).plot()
```
:::

A simpler take on this data is to focus on one dimension: weight. We can use the bin transform again to make a histogram with weight on the *x*-axis and frequency on the *y*-axis. This plot uses a [rect mark](./marks/rect.md) and an implicit [stack transform](./transforms/stack.md).

:::plot defer https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-vertical-histogram
```js
Plot.rectY(olympians, Plot.binX({y: "count"}, {x: "weight", fill: "sex"})).plot()
```
:::

Or if we’d prefer to show the two distributions separately as small multiples, we can [facet](./features/facets.md) the data along *y* (keeping the *fill* encoding for consistency, and adding grid lines and a rule at *y* = 0 to improve readability).

:::plot defer https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-faceted-histogram
```js
Plot.plot({
  grid: true,
  marks: [
    Plot.rectY(olympians, Plot.binX({y: "count"}, {x: "weight", fill: "sex", fy: "sex"})),
    Plot.ruleY([0])
  ]
})
```
