The **stackY** transform replaces the *y* channel with *y1* and *y2* channels to form vertical ‚Äústacks‚Äù grouped on *x*. (There‚Äôs also a **stackX** transform that replaces *x* with *x1* and *x2* for horizontal stacking grouped on *y*.) For example, consider this [line](../marks/line.md) chart of Florence Nightingale‚Äôs data on deaths in the Crimean War.

```js
Plot.plot({
  y: {
    grid: true
  },
  color: {
    legend: true
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.lineY(crimea, {x: "date", y: "deaths", stroke: "cause", marker: "circle"}),
    Plot.ruleY([0])
  ]
})
```

If we visualized this data with non-stacked [areas](../marks/area.md), using the _y2_ channel instead of _y_, the areas would overlap and be hard to read even with multiply blending.

```js
Plot.plot({
  y: {
    grid: true
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.areaY(crimea, {x: "date", y2: "deaths", fill: "cause", mixBlendMode: "multiply"}),
    Plot.ruleY([0])
  ]
})
```

The stackY transform replaces the *y* channel with *y1* and *y2* channels such that the area series are stacked from the *y* = 0 baseline. This makes the total deaths over time easier to read, while still showing the individual causes. The stackY transform is implicitly specified if you use the areaY *y* channel.

```js
Plot.plot({
  y: {
    grid: true
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.areaY(crimea, {x: "date", y: "deaths", fill: "cause"}),
    Plot.ruleY([0])
  ]
})
```

The stack transform works with [bars](../marks/bar.md), too. (With an ordinal *x*-axis of dates, we must format the ticks manually; Plot might get smarter in the future.)

```js
Plot.plot({
  x: {
    type: "band",
    tickFormat: d => d.toLocaleString("en", {month: "narrow"}),
    label: null
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.barY(crimea, {x: "date", y: "deaths", fill: "cause"}),
    Plot.ruleY([0])
  ]
})
```

As another example, here‚Äôs a stacked area chart of unemployment by month and industry from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (This chart has more than ten series, and hence colors are recycled; it would be better to aggregate the smaller industries into the ‚ÄúOther‚Äù series.)

```js
stacked.legend("color", {columns: "155px"})
```

```js
stacked = Plot.plot({
  y: {
    grid: true,
    label: "‚Üë Unemployed (thousands)"
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.areaY(unemployment, Plot.stackY({x: "date", y: "unemployed", fill: "industry", title: "industry"})),
    Plot.ruleY([0])
  ]
})
```

The stack transform stacks from a zero baseline by default, but this can be changed with the *offset* option. Four offset methods are supported:

* *center* - as proposed by [Havre *et al.*](https://innovis.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/innovis/uploads/Courses/InformationVisualizationDetails2009/Havre2000.pdf)
* *wiggle* - minimizing movement, as proposed by [Byron & Wattenberg](http://leebyron.com/streamgraph/stackedgraphs_byron_wattenberg.pdf)
* *normalize* - normalized to proportions in [0, 1]
* null - a zero baseline

The first two offsets are also called ‚Äústreamgraphs‚Äù for their fluid appearance.

```js
Plot.plot({
  y: {
    grid: true,
    label: "‚Üë Unemployed (thousands)"
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.areaY(unemployment, Plot.stackY({offset: "center", x: "date", y: "unemployed", fill: "industry"}))
  ]
})
```

The stack transform provides an *order* option for reordering series. The default respects the input order. The supported orders are:

* *sum* - order series by ascending total value
* *appearance* - order series by the index of their greatest value
* *inside-out* - order series as proposed by Byron & Wattenberg
* *z* - order series naturally by key (the *z*, *fill*, or *stroke* channel)
* *value* - order values in ascending order (*y* for stackY, *x* for stackX)
* some other string - order values according to the specified field
* a function - order values according to the specified function of data
* an array - order series by key in the specified order
* null - respect input order

The *reverse* option reverses any of the above orders. The default order is input order (null), unless the *wiggle* offset is used, in which case the default order is *inside-out* to minimize movement.

```js
Plot.plot({
  y: {
    grid: true,
    label: "‚Üë Unemployed (thousands)"
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.areaY(unemployment, Plot.stackY({offset: "wiggle", x: "date", y: "unemployed", fill: "industry"}))
  ]
})
```

While series are often ordered consistently, as above, that isn‚Äôt a requirement: the order of series can vary across stacks! This is most apparent with the *value* order, which places the largest value on the top similar to a ‚Äúribbon‚Äù chart. (See this technique in Nadja Popovich‚Äôs [‚ÄúHow Does Your State Make Electricity?‚Äù](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/24/climate/how-electricity-generation-changed-in-your-state.html) from 2018.)

```js
Plot.plot({
  y: {
    grid: true,
    label: "‚Üë Unemployed (thousands)"
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.areaY(unemployment, Plot.stackY({
      x: "date",
      y: "unemployed",
      curve: "catmull-rom",
      fill: "industry",
      order: "value"
    })),
    Plot.ruleY([0])
  ]
})
```

The *appearance* order excels when each series has a prominent peak, such as the chart below of the RIAA‚Äôs U.S. revenue broken down by format. CD sales started declining well before the rise of digital, suggesting¬†that the music industry was slow to provide a convenient digital product and hence lost substantial revenue to piracy. This chart also demonstrates how to share options across marks (the *xy* variable). The **stackY1** transform outputs the stacked *y1* channel as the *y* channel so that the baseline of each series can be stroked with white. (There are similar **stackY2**, **stackX1**, and **stackX2** transforms.)

```js
{
  const xy = {x: "year", y: "revenue", z: "format", order: "appearance", reverse: true};
  return Plot.plot({
    y: {
      grid: true,
      label: "‚Üë Annual revenue (billions, adj.)",
      transform: d => d / 1000
    },
    marks: [
      Plot.areaY(riaa, Plot.stackY({...xy, fill: "group", title: d => `${d.format}\n${d.group}`})),
      Plot.lineY(riaa, Plot.stackY1({...xy, stroke: "white", strokeWidth: 1})),
      Plot.ruleY([0])
    ],
    color: {legend: true}
  });
}
```

With the *expand* offset, the stack transform will compute the proportion of each series, such that each stack spans the interval [0, 1]. The *percent* scale option then multiplies these proportions by 100 to show percentages. Very little music is actually purchased these days‚Äînearly everything is rented by way of streaming services.

```js
{
  const xy = {x: "year", y: "revenue", z: "format", order: "appearance", offset: "expand", reverse: true};
  return Plot.plot({
    y: {
      grid: true,
      label: "‚Üë Revenue (%)",
      percent: true
    },
    marks: [
      Plot.areaY(riaa, Plot.stackY({...xy, fill: "group", title: d => `${d.format}\n${d.group}`})),
      Plot.lineY(riaa, Plot.stackY2({...xy, stroke: "white", strokeWidth: 1})),
      Plot.ruleY([0, 1])
    ]
  });
}
```

If the null offset is used for a zero baseline, then negative values will be stacked downwards from the baseline, producing a diverging stacked chart. This is especially useful for splitting series into two categories, such as in the chart of the gender and age of U.S. congress members below. This chart uses the stackY2 transform to position [dots](../marks/dot.md).

```js
Plot.plot({
  height: 300,
  x: {
    label: "Age ‚Üí",
    nice: true
  },
  y: {
    grid: true,
    label: "‚Üê Women ¬∑ Men ‚Üí",
    labelAnchor: "center",
    tickFormat: Math.abs
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.dot(congress, Plot.stackY2({
      x: d => 2021 - d.birth,
      y: d => d.gender === "M" ? 1 : d.gender === "F" ? -1 : 0,
      fill: "gender"
    })),
    Plot.ruleY([0])
  ]
})
```

Here is another view of the same data, faceted by every ten years of age, showing how the youngest members of congress are slightly increasing gender diversity, but with a long way still to go. (The tendency of women to live longer than men may also have an effect on the older brackets, though 90+ is a clear outlier.) The **stackX** transform also generates an *x* channel that is the midpoint of the *x1* and *x2* channels for centered labels; similarly **stackY** generates a transform for *y*, too.

```js
Plot.plot({
  height: 280,
  x: {
    percent: true
  },
  facet: {
    data: congress,
    y: d => Math.floor((2021 - d.birth) / 10) * 10
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.barX(congress, Plot.stackX(Plot.groupZ({x: "proportion-facet"}, {fill: "gender"}))),
    Plot.text(congress, Plot.stackX(Plot.groupZ({x: "proportion-facet", text: "first"}, {z: "gender", text: d => d.gender === "F" ? "Women" : d.gender === "M" ? "Men" : null}))),
    Plot.ruleX([0, 1])
  ]
})
```

One last example, perhaps slightly more upbeat, is this stacked area chart showing the rise of renewable energy generation in Iowa paired with the decline of coal.

```js
energy.legend("color")
```

```js
energy = Plot.plot({
  y: {
    grid: true,
    label: "‚Üë Net generation (million MWh)",
    transform: d => d / 1000
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.areaY(iowa, Plot.stackY({x: "year", y: "net_generation", fill: "source", title: "source"})),
    Plot.ruleY([0])
  ]
})
```

## Stack options

Transforms a length channel into starting and ending position channels by ‚Äústacking‚Äù elements that share a given position, such as transforming the **y** input channel into **y1** and **y2** output channels after grouping on **x** as in a stacked area chart. The starting position of each element equals the ending position of the preceding element in the stack.

The Plot.stackY transform groups on **x** and transforms **y** into **y1** and **y2**; the Plot.stackX transform groups on **y** and transforms **x** into **x1** and **x2**. If **y** is not specified for Plot.stackY, or if **x** is not specified for Plot.stackX, it defaults to the constant one, which is useful for constructing simple isotype charts (*e.g.*, stacked dots).

The supported stack options are:

- **offset** - the offset (or baseline) method
- **order** - the order in which stacks are layered
- **reverse** - true to reverse order

The following **order** methods are supported:

- null (default) - input order
- *value* - ascending value order (or descending with **reverse**)
- *x* - alias of *value*; for stackX only
- *y* - alias of *value*; for stackY only
- *sum* - order series by their total value
- *appearance* - order series by the position of their maximum value
- *inside-out* (default with *wiggle*) - order the earliest-appearing series on the inside
- a named field or function of data - order data by priority
- an array of *z* values

The **reverse** option reverses the effective order. For the *value* order, Plot.stackY uses the *y* value while Plot.stackX uses the *x* value. For the *appearance* order, Plot.stackY uses the *x* position of the maximum *y* value while Plot.stackX uses the *y* position of the maximum *x* value. If an array of *z* values are specified, they should enumerate the *z* values for all series in the desired order; this array is typically hard-coded or computed with [d3.groupSort](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/main/README.md#groupSort). Note that the input order (null) and *value* order can produce crossing paths: they do not guarantee a consistent series order across stacks.

The stack transform supports diverging stacks: negative values are stacked below zero while positive values are stacked above zero. For Plot.stackY, the **y1** channel contains the value of lesser magnitude (closer to zero) while the **y2** channel contains the value of greater magnitude (farther from zero); the difference between the two corresponds to the input **y** channel value. For Plot.stackX, the same is true, except for **x1**, **x2**, and **x** respectively.

After all values have been stacked from zero, an optional **offset** can be applied to translate or scale the stacks. The following **offset** methods are supported:

- null (default) - a zero baseline
- *normalize* - rescale each stack to fill [0, 1]
- *center* - align the centers of all stacks
- *wiggle* - translate stacks to minimize apparent movement
- a function to be passed a nested index, and start, end, and *z* values

If a given stack has zero total value, the *expand* offset will not adjust the stack‚Äôs position. Both the *center* and *wiggle* offsets ensure that the lowest element across stacks starts at zero for better default axes. The *wiggle* offset is recommended for streamgraphs, and if used, changes the default order to *inside-out*; see [Byron & Wattenberg](http://leebyron.com/streamgraph/).

If the offset is specified as a function, it will receive four arguments: an index of stacks nested by facet and then stack, an array of start values, an array of end values, and an array of *z* values. For stackX, the start and end values correspond to *x1* and *x2*, while for stackY, the start and end values correspond to *y1* and *y2*. The offset function is then responsible for mutating the arrays of start and end values, such as by subtracting a common offset for each of the indices that pertain to the same stack.

In addition to the **y1** and **y2** output channels, Plot.stackY computes a **y** output channel that represents the midpoint of **y1** and **y2**. Plot.stackX does the same for **x**. This can be used to position a label or a dot in the center of a stacked layer. The **x** and **y** output channels are lazy: they are only computed if needed by a downstream mark or transform.

If two arguments are passed to the stack transform functions below, the stack-specific options (**offset**, **order**, and **reverse**) are pulled exclusively from the first *options* argument, while any channels (*e.g.*, **x**, **y**, and **z**) are pulled from second *options* argument. Options from the second argument that are not consumed by the stack transform will be passed through. Using two arguments is sometimes necessary is disambiguate the option recipient when chaining transforms.

## stackY(*stack*, *options*)

```js
Plot.stackY({x: "year", y: "revenue", z: "format", fill: "group"})
```

Creates new channels **y1** and **y2**, obtained by stacking the original **y** channel for data points that share a common **x** (and possibly **z**) value. A new **y** channel is also returned, which lazily computes the middle value of **y1** and **y2**. The input **y** channel defaults to a constant 1, resulting in a count of the data points. The stack options (*offset*, *order*, and *reverse*) may be specified as part of the *options* object, if the only argument, or as a separate *stack* options argument.

## stackY1(*stack*, *options*)

```js
Plot.stackY1({x: "year", y: "revenue", z: "format", fill: "group"})
```

Equivalent to [Plot.stackY](#plotstackystack-options), except that the **y1** channel is returned as the **y** channel. This can be used, for example, to draw a line at the bottom of each stacked area.

## stackY2(*stack*, *options*)

```js
Plot.stackY2({x: "year", y: "revenue", z: "format", fill: "group"})
```

Equivalent to [Plot.stackY](#plotstackystack-options), except that the **y2** channel is returned as the **y** channel. This can be used, for example, to draw a line at the top of each stacked area.

## stackX(*stack*, *options*)

```js
Plot.stackX({y: "year", x: "revenue", z: "format", fill: "group"})
```

See Plot.stackY, but with *x* as the input value channel, *y* as the stack index, *x1*, *x2* and *x* as the output channels.

## stackX1(*stack*, *options*)

```js
Plot.stackX1({y: "year", x: "revenue", z: "format", fill: "group"})
```

Equivalent to [Plot.stackX](#plotstackxstack-options), except that the **x1** channel is returned as the **x** channel. This can be used, for example, to draw a line at the left edge of each stacked area.

## stackX2(*stack*, *options*)

```js
Plot.stackX2({y: "year", x: "revenue", z: "format", fill: "group"})
```

Equivalent to [Plot.stackX](#plotstackxstack-options), except that the **x2** channel is returned as the **x** channel. This can be used, for example, to draw a line at the right edge of each stacked area.
