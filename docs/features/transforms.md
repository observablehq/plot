# Transforms

**Transforms** derive data as part of the plot specification. This accelerates what is often the most onerous task in visualization: getting data into the right shape.

For example, given a [dataset of highway traffic](https://gist.github.com/chrtze/c74efb46cadb6a908bbbf5227934bfea) measured as vehicles per hour by location, plotting every observation is straightforward: use a [tick](../marks/tick.md) (or [dot](../marks/dot.md)) and assign **x** = vehicles per hour and **y** = location. But to draw a quantifiable insight, we may want a summary statistic such as the *median* traffic by location. üë©‚Äçüíª Below we use the [group transform](../transforms/group.md) to group by location and apply a *median* reducer to position the <span style="border-bottom: solid 2px var(--vp-c-red);">red</span> tick.

:::plot defer https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-sorted-groups
```js
Plot.plot({
  marginLeft: 120,
  x: {label: "Vehicles per hour (thousands) ‚Üí", transform: (x) => x / 1000},
  y: {label: null},
  marks: [
    Plot.ruleX([0]),
    Plot.tickX(
      traffic,
      {x: "vehicles", y: "location", strokeOpacity: 0.3}
    ),
    Plot.tickX(
      traffic,
      Plot.groupY(
        {x: "median"},
        {x: "vehicles", y: "location", stroke: "red", strokeWidth: 4, sort: {y: "x"}}
      )
    )
  ]
})
```
:::

As you might expect, traffic varies significantly throughout the day, so perhaps it would be better to look at the median by hour by location? Instead of grouping only by **y**, we can group by both **x** and **y** to produce a heatmap.

:::plot defer https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-sorted-heatmap
```js
Plot.plot({
  marginLeft: 120,
  padding: 0,
  y: {label: null},
  color: {legend: true, zero: true},
  marks: [
    Plot.cell(
      traffic,
      Plot.group(
        {fill: "median"},
        {x: (d) => d.date.getUTCHours(), y: "location", fill: "vehicles", inset: 0.5, sort: {y: "fill"}}
      )
    )
  ]
})
```
:::

Plot includes many useful transforms! For example, you can compute a [rolling average](../transforms/window.md) to smooth a noisy signal, [stack layers](../transforms/stack.md) for a streamgraph, or [dodge dots](../transforms/dodge.md) for a beeswarm. Plot‚Äôs various built-in transforms include: [bin](../transforms/bin.md), [centroid](../transforms/centroid.md), [dodge](../transforms/dodge.md), [filter](../transforms/filter.md), [group](../transforms/group.md), [hexbin](../transforms/hexbin.md), [interval](../transforms/interval.md), [map](../transforms/map.md), [normalize](../transforms/normalize.md), [reverse](../transforms/sort.md#reverse-options), [select](../transforms/select.md), [shuffle](../transforms/sort.md#shuffle-options), [sort](../transforms/sort.md), [stack](../transforms/stack.md), [tree](../transforms/tree.md), and [window](../transforms/window.md). If these don‚Äôt meet your needs, you can even implement a [custom transform](#custom-transforms).

Transforms are never required‚Äîyou can always aggregate and derive data yourself outside of Plot, and then pass in the binned values. For example, we could use [d3.bin](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/main/README.md#bin) to compute a histogram of athletes‚Äô¬†weights as an array of {*x0*, *x1*, *length*} objects.

```js
bins = d3.bin().thresholds(80).value((d) => d.weight)(olympians)
```

We can then pass that to the [rect mark](../marks/rect.md), assigning to the **x1**, **x2**, and **y2** channels:

:::plot defer
```js
Plot.rectY(bins, {x1: "x0", x2: "x1", y2: "length"}).plot()
```
:::

:::info
This is for demonstration only; you wouldn‚Äôt normally bin ‚Äúby hand‚Äù¬†as shown here.
:::

But Plot‚Äôs transforms are often more convenient, especially in conjunction with Plot‚Äôs other features such as [faceting](./facets.md) and automatic grouping by **z**. For example, if we want to add a color encoding to our histogram, we simply add the **fill** option and the bin transform partitions each bin accordingly; doing this with d3.bin would be a lot more work!

:::plot defer https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-vertical-histogram
```js
Plot.rectY(olympians, Plot.binX({y: "count"}, {x: "weight", fill: "sex"})).plot({color: {legend: true}})
```
:::

Plot‚Äôs transforms typically take two *options* objects as arguments: the first object contains the *transform* options (above, `{y: "count"}`), while the second object contains *mark* options to be ‚Äúpassed through‚Äù to the mark (`{x: "weight", fill: "sex"}`). The transform returns a new options object representing the *transformed* mark options to be passed to a mark.

Breaking down the above code:

```js
const options = {x: "weight", fill: "sex"}; // initial mark options
const binOptions = {y: "count"}; // bin transform options
const binned = Plot.binX(binOptions, options); // transformed mark options
const rect = Plot.rectY(olympians, binned); // rect mark
const plot = rect.plot({color: {legend: true}}); // plot!
```

:::tip
If a transform isn‚Äôt doing what you expect, try inspecting the options object returned by the transform. Does it contain the options you expect?
:::

Transforms can derive channels (such as **y** above) as well as changing the default options. For example, the bin transform sets default insets for a one-pixel gap between adjacent rects.

Transforms are composable: you can pass *options* through more than one transform before passing it to a mark. For example, above it‚Äôs a bit difficult to compare the weight distribution by sex because there are fewer <span :style="{borderBottom: `solid 2px ${d3.schemeTableau10[0]}`}">female</span> than <span :style="{borderBottom: `solid 2px ${d3.schemeTableau10[1]}`}">male</span> athletes in the data. We can remove this effect using the [normalize transform](../transforms/normalize.md) with the *sum* reducer.

:::plot defer https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-overlapping-relative-histogram
```js-vue
Plot.plot({
  y: {percent: true},
  marks: [
    Plot.rectY(
      olympians,
      Plot.normalizeY(
        "sum", // normalize each series by the sum per series
        Plot.binX(
          {y2: "count"}, // disable implicit stack transform
          {x: "weight", fill: "sex", mixBlendMode: "{{$dark ? "screen" : "multiply"}}"}
        )
      )
    )
  ]
})
```
:::

And, as you may have wondered above, many of Plot‚Äôs [marks](./marks.md) provide implicit transforms: for example, the [rectY mark](../marks/rect.md) applies an implicit [stackY transform](../transforms/stack.md) if you use the **y** option, and the [dot mark](../marks/dot.md) applies an implicit [sort transform](../transforms/sort.md) to mitigate the effect of occlusion by drawing the smallest dots on top.

## Custom transforms

For greater control, you can also implement a custom **transform** function, allowing data, indexes, or channels to be derived prior to rendering. Custom transforms are rarely implemented directly; see the built-in transforms above. For example, below we implement the [filter transform](../transforms/filter.md) ‚Äúby hand‚Äù as a custom transform to show the unemployment rates only in Michigan metropolitan divisions.

:::plot defer https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-custom-transform-example
```js{16-23}
Plot.plot({
  y: {
    grid: true,
    label: "‚Üë Unemployment (%)"
  },
  color: {
    domain: [false, true],
    range: ["#ccc", "red"]
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.ruleY([0]),
    Plot.line(bls, {
      x: "date",
      y: "unemployment",
      z: "division",
      transform: (data, facets) => ({
        data,
        facets: facets.map((facet) => {
          return facet.filter((i) => {
            return /, MI /.test(data[i].division);
          });
        })
      })
    })
  ]
})
```
:::

The **transform** function is passed three arguments, *data*, *facets*, and *options* representing the mark‚Äôs data and facet indexes, and the plot‚Äôs options; it must then return a {*data*, *facets*} object with the transformed data and facet indexes. The *facets* are represented as a nested array of arrays such as [[0, 1, 3, ‚Ä¶], [2, 5, 10, ‚Ä¶], ‚Ä¶]; each element in *facets* specifies the zero-based indexes of elements in *data* that are in a given facet (*i.e.*, have a distinct value in the associated *fx* or *fy* dimension).

If the **transform** option is specified, it supersedes any basic transforms (*i.e.*, the **filter**, **sort** and **reverse** options are ignored). However, the **transform** option is rarely used directly; instead one of Plot‚Äôs built-in transforms are used, and these transforms automatically compose with the basic **filter**, **sort** and **reverse** transforms.

While transform functions often produce new *data* or *facets*, they may return the passed-in *data* and *facets* as-is, and often have a side-effect of constructing derived channels. For example, the count of elements in a [groupX transform](../transforms/group.md) might be returned as a new *y* channel. In this case, the transform is typically expressed as an options transform: a function that takes a mark *options* object and returns a new, transformed options object, where the returned options object implements the **transform** option. Transform functions should not mutate the input *data* or *facets*. Likewise options transforms should not mutate the input *options* object.

When implementing a custom transform for generic usage, keep in mind that it needs to be compatible with Plot‚Äôs [faceting system](./facets.md), which partitions the original dataset into discrete subsets.

## Custom initializers

Initializers are a special class of transform; whereas transforms operate in abstract data space, initializers operate in screen space such as pixel coordinates and colors. For example, initializers can modify a marks‚Äô positions to avoid occlusion. Initializers are invoked *after* the initial scales are constructed and can modify the channels or derive new channels; these in turn may (or may not, as desired) be passed to scales. Plot‚Äôs [hexbin](../transforms/hexbin.md) and [dodge](../transforms/dodge.md) transforms are initializers.

You can specify a custom initializer by specifying a function as the mark **initializer** option. This function is called after the scales have been computed, and receives as inputs the (possibly transformed) array of *data*, the *facets* index of elements of this array that belong to each facet, the input *channels* (as an object of named channels), the *scales*, and the *dimensions*. The mark itself is the *this* context. The initializer function must return an object with *data*, *facets*, and new *channels*. Any new channels are merged with existing channels, replacing channels of the same name.

If an initializer desires a channel that is not supported by the downstream mark, additional channels can be declared using the mark **channels** option.

## transform(*options*, *transform*)

```js
Plot.transform(options, (data, facets) => {
  return {
    data,
    facets: facets.map((I) => I.filter(() => Math.random() > 0.5))
  };
})
```
Given an *options* object that may specify some basic transforms (**filter**, **sort**, or **reverse**) or a custom **transform** function, composes those transforms if any with the given *transform* function, returning a new *options* object. If a custom **transform** function is present on the given *options*, any basic transforms are ignored. Any additional input *options* are passed through in the returned *options* object. This method facilitates applying the basic transforms prior to applying the given custom *transform* and is used internally by Plot‚Äôs built-in transforms.

## initializer(*options*, *initializer*)

This helper composes the *initializer* function with any other transforms present in the *options*, and returns a new *options* object. It is used internally by Plot‚Äôs built-in initializer transforms.

## valueof(*data*, *value*, *type*)

```js
Plot.valueof(aapl, "Close")
```

Given an iterable *data* and some *value* accessor, returns an array (a column) of the specified *type* with the corresponding value of each element of the data. The *value* accessor may be one of the following types:

* a string - corresponding to the field accessor (`(d) => d[value]`)
* an accessor function - called as *type*.from(*data*, *value*)
* a number, Date, or boolean ‚Äî resulting in an array uniformly filled with the *value*
* an object with a **transform** method ‚Äî called as *value*.transform(*data*)
* an array of values - returning the same
* null or undefined - returning the same

If *type* is specified, it must be Array or a similar class that implements the [Array.from](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from) interface such as a typed array. When *type* is Array or a typed array class, the return value of valueof will be an instance of the same (or null or undefined). When *type* is a typed array, values will be implicitly coerced numbers, and if *type* is Float64Array, Float32Array, or a subclass of the same, null values will be implicitly replaced with NaN. If *type* is not specified, valueof may return either an array or a typed array (or null or undefined).

valueof is not guaranteed to return a new array. When a transform method is used, or when the given *value* is an array that is compatible with the requested *type*, the array may be returned as-is without making a copy.

## column(*source*)

```js
const [X, setX] = Plot.column();
```

This helper for constructing derived columns returns a [*column*, *setColumn*] array. The *column* object implements *column*.transform, returning whatever value was most recently passed to *setColumn*. If *setColumn* is not called, then *column*.transform returns undefined. If a *source* is specified, then *column*.label exposes the given *source*‚Äôs label, if any: if *source* is a string as when representing a named field of data, then *column*.label is *source*; otherwise *column*.label propagates *source*.label. This allows derived columns to propagate a human-readable axis or legend label.

This method is used by Plot‚Äôs transforms to derive channels; the associated columns are populated (derived) when the **transform** option function is invoked.

## identity

```js
Plot.contour(data, {width: w, height: h, fill: Plot.identity})
```

This channel helper returns a source array as-is, avoiding an extra copy when defining a channel as being equal to the data.

## indexOf

```js
Plot.lineY(numbers, {x: Plot.indexOf, y: Plot.identity})
```

This channel helper returns an array of numbers [0, 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶]. It is used internally by marks with zero-based index defaults for channels.
