# Markers

A [marker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/marker) defines a graphic drawn on vertices of a [line](#line) or a [link](#link) mark. The supported marker options are:

* **markerStart** - the marker for the starting point of a line segment
* **markerMid** - the marker for any intermediate point of a line segment
* **markerEnd** - the marker for the end point of a line segment
* **marker** - shorthand for setting the marker on all points

The following named markers are supported:

* *none* (default) - no marker
* *arrow* - an arrowhead
* *dot* - a filled *circle* without a stroke and 2.5px radius
* *circle*, equivalent to *circle-fill* - a filled circle with a white stroke and 3px radius
* *circle-stroke* - a hollow circle with a colored stroke and a white fill and 3px radius

If *marker* is true, it defaults to *circle*. If *marker* is a function, it will be called with a given *color* and must return an SVG marker element.

The primary color of a marker is inherited from the *stroke* of the associated mark. The *arrow* marker is [automatically oriented](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/orient) such that it points in the tangential direction of the path at the position the marker is placed. The *circle* markers are centered around the given vertex. Note that for lines whose curve is not *linear*, markers are not necessarily drawn at the data positions given by *x* and *y*; marker placement is determined by the (possibly BÃ©zier) path segments generated by the curve. To ensure that symbols are drawn at a given *x* and *y* position, consider using a [dot](#dot).
