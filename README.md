# Observable Plot

**Observable Plot** is a JavaScript library for exploratory data visualization.

* [Introduction](#introduction)
* Reference (TODO)
* [Development](./DEVELOPMENT.md)

## Introduction

(TODO) Something about the Grammar of Graphics (scales, marks, composition,
automatic axes; similar to Vega-Lite and ggplot2). Something about D3 (Plot’s
development is led by the author of D3, Mike Bostock, and builds on D3, but is
intended more for fast exploration than bespoke presentation). Something about
extensibility.

Observable Plot adheres to several principles:

* Be concise and memorable for common tasks.
* Be flexible regarding input data.
* Provide good defaults, but allow configuration.
* Support faceting (small multiples) in all charts.
* Support interaction (selection) in all charts.
* Provide an open, extensible foundation for visualization.

Plot tries to be **concise and memorable** for common tasks. This makes Plot easier to learn, easier to remember, and faster for exploring data. For example, given a tabular dataset loaded from a CSV file with columns *Date* and *Close*, here’s a line chart of Apple’s stock price:

<img src="./img/line-aapl-date-close.png" width="640" height="240" alt="A line chart of the daily closing price of Apple stock, 2013–2018">

```js
Plot.plot({
  height: 240,
  marks: [
    Plot.line(data, {x: "Date", y: "Close"})
  ]
})
```

And here’s a line chart of unemployment rates across metropolitan area:

<img src="./img/line-bls-date-unemployment-division.png" width="640" height="240" alt="A line chart of the unemployment rate for various U.S. metropolitan areas, 2000–2013">

```js
Plot.plot({
  height: 240,
  marks: [
    Plot.line(data, {x: "date", y: "unemployment", z: "division"})
  ]
})
```

A chart created by Plot is simply an SVG element that you can put anywhere on the page.

```js
const chart = Plot.plot(…); // create the plot
document.body.append(chart); // add it to the DOM
```

Data in the wild comes in all shapes, so Plot is **flexible regarding input data**: data can be an array of objects with named properties (rows, as above), parallel “flat” arrays or iterables of values (columns), or even functions to compute values on-the-fly.

```js
// As rows…
Plot.line(data, {x: "Date", y: "Close"}) // named fields
Plot.line(data, {x: d => d.Date, y: d => d.Close}) // accessor functions
```

```js
// As columns…
Plot.line(null, {x: dates, y: closes}) // explicit values
Plot.line({length}, {x: (_, i) => dates[i], y: (_, i) => closes[i]}) // accessor functions
Plot.line(index, {x: i => dates[i], y: i => closes[i]}) // as function of index
```

Above, the columns might be computed from rows as:

```js
const length = data.length;
const dates = data.map(d => d.Date);
const closes = data.map(d => d.Close);
const index = data.map((d, i) => i);
```

For example, here’s a line chart of random *y*-values where *x* encodes the index of the input data:

<img src="./img/line-random.png" width="640" height="240" alt="A line chart of a uniform random variable">

```js
Plot.plot({
  height: 240,
  x: {axis: null}, // hide the x-axis
  y: {ticks: 10}, // show about 10 ticks on the y-axis
  marks: [
    Plot.lineY({length: 500}, {y: Math.random})
  ]
})
```

And similarly here’s a line chart of a random walk using [d3.cumsum](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#cumsum) and [d3.randomNormal](https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/README.md#randomNormal):

<img src="./img/line-random-walk.png" width="640" height="240" alt="A line chart of a random walk">

```js
Plot.plot({
  height: 240,
  x: {axis: null}, // hide the x-axis
  y: {ticks: 10}, // show about 10 ticks on the y-axis
  marks: [
    Plot.lineY(d3.cumsum({length: 500}, d3.randomNormal()))
  ]
})
```

If you don’t specify a scale type explicitly, Plot will try to infer a suitable one based on the input values. For example, a UTC (temporal) scale is used for Date instances, a point (ordinal) scale is used for strings, and a linear (quantitative) scale is used for numbers.

It’s not just line charts, of course. Here’s another useful chart type, the histogram:

<img src="./img/histogram-aapl-volume.png" width="640" height="240" alt="A histogram of daily trading volume for Apple stock, 2013–2018">

```js
Plot.plot({
  height: 240,
  marks: [
    Plot.binRectY(data, {x: "Volume"}),
    Plot.ruleY([0]) // add a rule at y = 0
  ]
})
```

The bin mark is shorthand for a rect mark with a bin transform; the bin
transform [bins](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#bins)
quantitative data into discrete bins, then the rect mark visualizes the number
of data points in each bin as filled rectangles that extend up from the
*x*-axis.

While the charts above use shorthand defaults, Plot charts are **highly configurable**. Here’s a more longhand representation of the unemployment chart above, with a dash of customization:

<img src="./img/line-bls-date-unemployment-division-custom.png" width="640" height="240" alt="A line chart of the unemployment rate for various U.S. metropolitan areas, 2000–2013">

```js
Plot.plot({
  height: 240,
  x: {
    label: null // hide the x-axis label
  },
  y: {
    grid: true, // show grid lines
    label: "↑ Unemployment (%)" // custom y-axis label
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.line(data, {
      x: "date",
      y: "unemployment",
      z: "division",
      strokeWidth: 1, // thinner stroke
      strokeOpacity: 0.5 // allow blending
    }),
    Plot.ruleY([0]) // add a rule at y = 0
  ]
})
```

(TODO) With Plot, **all charts are interactive inputs**. A Plot chart element exposes a *value* property that represents the currently-selected data, and emits an *input* event whenever the selection changes in response to user interaction. This makes it easy to pipe the selection from one chart into another chart (or table) for coordinated views, and it works beautifully with [Observable’s reactive views](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/introduction-to-views).

```js
const chart = Plot.plot(…);
chart.oninput = () => console.log(chart.value);
```

Lastly, Plot provides **an open, extensible foundation** for visualization. While Plot includes a variety of standard mark types out of the box, it is designed to be extended. New mark types can be used to create one-off custom charts, or for reuse, without needing to fork Plot’s internals. Plot can be extended over time by the community to make a wide variety of visualization techniques more accessible. To learn how to extend Plot, see [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md).
