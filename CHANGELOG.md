# Observable Plot - Changelog

Year: **2023** ¬∑ [2022](./CHANGELOG-2022.md) ¬∑ [2021](./CHANGELOG-2021.md)

## 0.6.7

*Not yet released. These are forthcoming changes in the main branch.*

The new [tip mark](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/tip) renders annotations in a floating box anchored to a given position in **x** and **y**. Like the text mark, it supports soft-wrapping and multi-line text, and can be used to draw attention to points of interest and add commentary.

<img src="./img/tip-title.png" width="640" alt="A line chart of Apple stock price from 2013 to 2018, with an annotation describing the decline from 2015 through mid-2016, followed by a recovery.">

```js
Plot.plot({
  y: {grid: true},
  marks: [
    Plot.lineY(aapl, {x: "Date", y: "Close"}),
    Plot.tip(
      [`Apple stock drops 8% after the company misses Q2 revenue targets and reports declining iPhone sales. It reaches a two-year low of $90.34 on May 12.`],
      {x: new Date("2016-05-12"), y: 90.34, dy: 3, anchor: "top"}
    )
  ]
})
```

If the **title** channel is omitted, the tip mark automatically shows the name and value of all channels.

<img src="./img/tip.png" width="640" alt="A line chart of Apple stock price from 2013 to 2018, with an annotation on May 12, 2016, showing the two-year low closing price of $90.34.">

```js
Plot.plot({
  y: {grid: true},
  marks: [
    Plot.lineY(aapl, {x: "Date", y: "Close"}),
    Plot.tip({length: 1}, {x: new Date("2016-05-12"), y: 90.34, dy: 3, anchor: "top"})
  ]
})
```

The tip mark is often paired with the new [pointer interaction](https://observablehq.com/plot/interactions/pointer), which dynamically filters a mark such that only the instance closest to the pointer is rendered. This allows the tip mark to reveal more information about the datum closest to the pointer, say when hovering a scatterplot or line chart.

The pointer interaction can also be paired with any mark: a red dot, say, to emphasize the focused point, or a rule to highlight its *x* or *y* position. You can also independently control the target position from the display, say to show the currently-focused point‚Äôs value in the top-left corner of the chart with a text mark.

[TODO Example of a text mark driven by the pointer interaction.]

The pointer interaction supports ‚Äúclick-to-stick‚Äù: if you click on the chart, the currently-focused point will remain focused until you click again. By temporarily locking the focused point, you can select text from the tip for copy and paste.

The new **tip** mark option adds an implicit tip mark with pointer interaction derived from the current mark.

[TODO Animated tip + pointer example]

```js
Plot.lineY(aapl, {x: "Date", y: "Close", tip: true}).plot({y: {grid: true}})
```

When the **tip** option is truthy, the **title** channel is no longer applied using an SVG title element; it is instead rendered via the tip mark. The auto mark sets the **tip** option to true by default.

The pointer interaction also powers the new crosshair mark, which provides an alternative strategy for showing the *x* (horizontal‚ÜîÔ∏é position) and *y* (vertical‚ÜïÔ∏é position) of the closest point to the pointer.

<img src="./img/crosshair.png" width="640" alt="A line chart of Apple stock price from 2013 to 2018, with a crosshair centered over May 12, 2016, showing a closing price of $90.34.">

```js
Plot.plot({
  marginLeft: 50,
  marks: [
    Plot.lineY(aapl, {x: "Date", y: "Close"}),
    Plot.crosshair(aapl, {x: "Date", y: "Close"}) // TODO crosshairX
  ]
})
```

The new **labelArrow** axis mark option and implicit arrow behavior for axis labels.

Ordinal scales are now smarter about choosing a default time format when the **interval** option is a yearly interval: the four-digit year is (YYYY) shown instead of year, month, and day (YYYY-01-01).

Color scales now default to a *categorical* scale when a categorical color scheme is specified. (This avoids an ‚Äúunknown quantitative scheme‚Äù error.)

Time intervals can now be specified as integer multiples of a base time interval, such as *3 months* or *10 years*.

The new **imageFilter** mark option.

The new **render** transform mark option.

Mark transforms are now passed the plot‚Äôs *options* as a third argument. This allows the group, bin, and stack transforms (and other transforms) to check if the scale has a declared **interval** option, and if so, apply that interval before grouping.

The autoSpec method now returns the name of the explicit mark and transform implementations as **markImpl** and **transformImpl** respectively, along with the **markOptions** and **transformOptions** needed to instantiate them.

The normalize and window transforms now accept two-argument ‚Äúindex-aware‚Äù reducers. The map transform now accepts a two-argument index-aware map method, too.

Fix a bug where the *opacity* channel didn‚Äôt automatically opt-out of the *opacity* scale when all values are in the interval [0,1].

Fix a bug where the frame mark would crash if a channel-eligible option such as **fill** were specified as an invalid CSS color string, such as *bluez*. The frame mark now supports channel-eligible options to be specified as abstract values, in which case the abstract values will be encoded using a scale; for example, setting **fill** to *Biscoe* would apply an *ordinal* *color* scale.

Fix a bug when filtering facets and computing facet anchors with non-primitive facet domains, such as dates.

Fix a bug where the position defaults for the rectX, rectY, barX, and barY marks were only applied if the *options* object was strictly undefined; now the position defaults apply if the relevant position options are undefined.

Fix *z*-order across facets. Fix *z*-order of facet axes, which should be drawn below rather than above other marks, as with other axes.

Fix the auto mark to chose the rect mark instead of rectX or rectY when appropriate, and likewise choose correctly between line, lineX, and lineY, and areaX and areaY.

The mapX transform now defaults **x** to identity if none of **x**, **x1**, and **x2** are specified; the mapY transform does the same for **y**.

TODO Change to maybeOptionalZero when **x** is strictly null?

The plot context now exposes the ownerSVGElement.

The text mark now positions multi-line text using the *dy* attribute instead of the *y* attribute.

When faceting, the plot dimensions now includes **facet**.**width** and **facet**.**height** for the plot‚Äôs outer dimensions.

Derived channels can now declare **source** and **hint** options which are used by the tip mark.

## 0.6.6

[Released April 26, 2023.](https://github.com/observablehq/plot/releases/tag/v0.6.6)

**Plot has a new documentation website!**

üëâ https://observablehq.com/plot üëà

The [image mark](./README.md#image) can now generate circular images with the **r** channel, and rotate images with the **rotate** channel.

The [axis mark](./README.md#axis) now properly respects the **margin** shorthand option, changing the default for **marginTop**, **marginRight**, **marginBottom**, and **marginLeft**. The axis mark now correctly renders the axis label when the **href** option is used, or any other option that may be interpreted as a channel.

Facet scale domains are now imputed correctly when the **sort** mark option is used with a **limit**, or otherwise causing the facet domain to be truncated. Plot no longer generates a spurious warning when faceting and using non-array data, such as an Arquero table. The **interval** scale option, when expressed as a fractional number such as 0.2, now has better floating point precision.

The [Plot.indexOf](./README.md#plotindexof) channel transform, used internally by some mark shorthand, is now exported.

Plot has a few improvements for server-side rendering. Plot now assumes a high pixel density display when headless. The default class name for plots is now deterministically generated (`plot-d6a7b5`) rather than randomly generated; this makes it easier to apply overrides to Plot‚Äôs default styles with an external stylesheet. (The default class name will change if Plot‚Äôs default styles change in a future release.) The **className** plot option is now inherited by a plot‚Äôs legends, if any. The density mark now respects the Plot‚Äôs **document** option, and the **caption** option now uses a duck test instead of testing against the global Node.

## 0.6.5

[Released April 1, 2023.](https://github.com/observablehq/plot/releases/tag/v0.6.5)

**TypeScript!** The feature you asked for most is here. üéâ Plot now exports TypeScript type declarations (.d.ts) with precise types and documentation for all of Plot‚Äôs public API. This allows code editors such as VS Code to offer better suggestions, complete with inline documentation. For example, if you type ‚ÄúPlot.g‚Äù, Plot.geo is now suggested:

<img src="./img/ts-property.png" width="840" alt="A screenshot of VS Code, showing suggested completions for Plot.g, including geo, geoCentroid, graticule, and other methods. A details panel showing documentation for Plot.geo, the top suggestion, is also shown.">

Function calls also have hints, showing their expected arguments.

<img src="./img/ts-function.png" width="840" alt="A screenshot of VS Code, showing documentation for calling Plot.geo, including the data and options arguments.">

Types are especially useful for suggesting well-known names, such as projections, scale types, and color schemes.

<img src="./img/ts-enum.png" width="840" alt="A screenshot of VS Code, showing suggested completions for the color scale scheme option. An open menu lists color schemes, including Accent, Blues, BrBG, BuGn, and more.">

TypeScript also helps for reading code; hover any symbol and immediately see the relevant documentation.

<img src="./img/ts-hover.png" width="840" alt="A screenshot of VS Code, with the mouse hovering the color scale‚Äôs unknown option. A panel shows documentation explaining the option.">

Lastly, if you‚Äôre using Plot in a TypeScript project, you can now benefit from additional static type checking to find errors.

<img src="./img/ts-error.png" width="840" alt="A screenshot of VS Code, showing an red squiggly underline under a typo in the code, which accidentally calls mark.plots. A panel suggests calling mark.plot instead.">

If you have suggestions or clarifications on how to improve the documentation, please open an issue or discussion, or send us a pull request.

The **strokeOpacity**, **fillOpacity**, and **opacity** channels now opt-out of the *opacity* scale by default when all values are numbers in the range [0, 1]; to opt-in to the *opacity* scale, specify the channel as {value, scale: true}. The raster mark now also supports scale overrides.

The scale **nice** option now accepts named time intervals such as *day* and *week*. The new *quarter* and *half* time intervals represent quarters (three months) and half-years (six months). The quantile scale now supports the **unknown** option. BigInt channels are now supported; values are coerced to numbers. Color legends now support the **opacity** option.

The text mark no longer crashes when a NaN tick value is specified for an axis. The **className** option now allows mixed-case class names. Channel-derived scale domains now correctly handle non-orderable values, duplicate values, and mark transforms. Plot.auto now renders correctly when a non-zero **reduce** is used in conjunction with the *bar* **mark**, and in some cases when the **zero** option is specified. The **zero** option no longer changes the default mark type, and Plot.autoSpec now materializes the **zero** option.

The interfaces for reduce and map implementations have changed. To better disambiguate from arrays, reduce implementations now have a *reduceIndex* method instead of a *reduce* method, and map implementations now have a *mapIndex* method instead of a *map* method. The old interfaces are still supported, but now deprecated.

## 0.6.4

[Released February 28, 2023.](https://github.com/observablehq/plot/releases/tag/v0.6.4)

The new top-level [**aspectRatio** option](./README.md#layout-options) changes the default plot **height** such that, assuming both *x* and *y* are *linear* scales, a scaled unit distance in *x* divided by a scaled unit distance in *y* is the given aspect ratio. For example, if *x* and *y* represent the same units (say, degrees Fahrenheit), and if the **aspectRatio** is one, then scaled distances in *x* and *y* will be equivalent.

<img src="./img/aspect-ratio.webp" width="650" alt="A scatterplot of daily temperature variation (y) vs. daily low temperature (x).">

```js
Plot.plot({
  aspectRatio: 1,
  grid: true,
  x: {label: "Daily low temperature (¬∞F) ‚Üí", tickSpacing: 40},
  y: {label: "‚Üë Daily temperature variation (Œî¬∞F)", tickSpacing: 40},
  color: {scheme: "rainbow", nice: true, legend: true, tickFormat: "%b"},
  marks: [
    Plot.ruleY([0]),
    Plot.dot(weather, {
      x: (d) => d.temp_min,
      y: (d) => d.temp_max - d.temp_min,
      fill: (d) => (d = new Date(d.date), d.setUTCFullYear(2020), d)
    })
  ]
})
```

The new **textOverflow** option for the [text mark](./README.md#text) allows text to be truncated when a line of text is longer than the specified **lineWidth**. Overflowing characters can either be clipped (*clip*) or replaced with an ellipsis (*ellipsis*), either at the start, middle, or end of each line.

<img src="./img/text-overflow.webp" width="620" alt="A demonstration of Plot‚Äôs text overflow methods, including clip-start, clip-end, ellipsis-start, ellipsis-middle, ellipsis-end, applied to titles of Hayao Miyazaki films.">

When wrapping or truncating, the text mark now more accurately estimates the width of ellipses and emojis, and no longer separates combining marks or emoji character sequences such as üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶.

The [link mark](./README.md#link) now respects the current [**projection**](./README.md#projection-options), if any, given the default [**curve**](./README.md#curves) of *auto*. This matches the behavior of the line mark. To opt-out of the projection and draw a straight line, set the **curve** to *linear*.

The [image mark](./README.md#image) now supports the **imageRendering** option. (Note: Safari currently ignores the SVG image-rendering attribute.)

You can now override the scale for a given [mark channel](./README.md#mark-options) by specifying the corresponding option as a {value, scale} object. For example, to force the **stroke** channel to be unscaled, interpreting the associated values as literal color strings:

```js
Plot.dot(data, {stroke: {value: "foo", scale: null}})
```

To instead force the **stroke** channel to be bound to the *color* scale regardless of the provided values, say:

```js
Plot.dot(data, {stroke: {value: "foo", scale: "color"}})
```

Color channels (**fill** and **stroke**) are bound to the *color* scale by default, unless the provided values are all valid CSS color strings or nullish, in which case the values are interpreted literally and unscaled. Likewise, if the dot mark‚Äôs **symbol** channel values are all symbols, symbol names, or nullish, values are interpreted literally and unscaled; otherwise, the channel is bound to the *symbol* scale. (If some color channels are literal values while other color channels are not, the channels with literal values will now automatically opt-out of the color scale; the same goes for symbol channels. This deviates from the previous behavior, where *all* channels associated with a scale were required to be literal values in order to have the scale default to an *identity* scale.)

The mark [**facetAnchor** option](./README.md#facet-options) can now be set to *empty* such that a mark is only rendered on empty facets. This is typically used for annotation.

The new Plot.autoSpec method takes *data* and *options* suitable for [Plot.auto](./README.md#aut) and returns a corresponding *options* object with default options realized. While intended primarily as an internal helper, Plot.autoSpec may be useful for debugging by letting you inspect which mark and reducers are chosen by Plot.auto.

Fix Plot.auto to only default to the *bar* mark if *x* or *y* is zeroed. Fix Plot.auto‚Äôs support for the *area* mark. Fix Plot.auto‚Äôs use of the *bar* mark with possibly ordinal reducers. Fix a bug where arrays of values could be erroneously interpreted as reducers. Fix a crash when the mark **facet** option is set to *exclude*, but the mark is not faceted; the option is now ignored. Fix a crash coercing BigInt values to numbers.

## 0.6.3

[Released February 6, 2023.](https://github.com/observablehq/plot/releases/tag/v0.6.3)

The new [auto mark](./README.md#auto) ([Plot.auto](./README.md#plotautodata-options)) automatically selects a mark type that best represents the given dimensions of data according to some simple heuristics. For example,

[<img src="./img/auto-dot.webp" width="640" alt="A scatterplot height and weight of olympic athletes.">](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-auto)

```js
Plot.auto(olympians, {x: "height", y: "weight"}).plot()
```

makes a scatterplot (equivalent to [dot](./README.md#plotdotdata-options)); adding **color** as

[<img src="./img/auto-bin-color.webp" width="640" alt="A heatmap of .">](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-auto)

```js
Plot.auto(olympians, {x: "height", y: "weight", color: "count"}).plot()
```

makes a heatmap (equivalent to [rect](./README.md#plotrectdata-options) and [bin](./README.md#plotbinoutputs-options); chosen since _height_ and _weight_ are quantitative); switching to

[<img src="./img/auto-line.webp" width="640" alt="A line chart of Apple stock price.">](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-auto)

```js
Plot.auto(aapl, {x: "Date", y: "Close"}).plot()
```

makes a line chart (equivalent to [lineY](./README.md#plotlineydata-options); chosen because the selected *x* dimension *Date* is temporal and monotonic, _i.e._, the data is in chronological order);

[<img src="./img/auto-bin.webp" width="640" alt="A histogram of penguin body mass.">](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-auto)

```js
Plot.auto(penguins, {x: "body_mass_g"}).plot()
```

makes a histogram (equivalent to [rectY](./README.md#plotrectydata-options) and [binX](./README.md#plotbinxoutputs-options); chosen because the _body_mass_g_ column is quantitative); and

[<img src="./img/auto-group.webp" width="640" alt="A vertical bar chart of penguins by island.">](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-auto)

```js
Plot.auto(penguins, {x: "island"}).plot()
```

makes a bar chart (equivalent to [barY](./README.md#plotbarydata-options) and [groupX](./README.md#plotgroupxoutputs-options); chosen because the _island_ column is categorical). The auto mark is intended to support fast exploratory analysis where the goal is to get a useful plot as quickly as possible. It‚Äôs also great if you‚Äôre new to Plot, since you can get started with a minimal API.

Plot‚Äôs new [axis](./README.md#axis) and [grid](./README.md#axis) marks allow customization and styling of axes. This has been one of our most asked-for features, closing more than a dozen feature requests (see [#1197](https://github.com/observablehq/plot/pull/1197))! The new axis mark composes a [vector](./README.md#vector) for tick marks and a [text](./README.md#text) for tick and axis labels. As such, you can use the rich capabilities of these marks, such the **lineWidth** option to wrap long text labels.

[<img src="./img/axis-multiline.webp" width="640" alt="A bar chart of parodical survey responses demonstrating text wrapping of long axis labels.">](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-auto)

```js
Plot.plot({
  y: {percent: true},
  marks: [
    Plot.axisX({label: null, lineWidth: 8, marginBottom: 40}),
    Plot.axisY({label: "‚Üë Responses (%)"}),
    Plot.barY(responses, {x: "name", y: "value"}),
    Plot.ruleY([0])
  ]
})
```

And since axes and grids are now proper marks, you can interleave them with other marks, for example to produce ggplot2-style axes with a gray background and white grid lines.

[<img src="./img/axis-ggplot.webp" width="640" alt="A line chart of Apple‚Äôs stock price demonstrating styled axes with a gray background overlaid with white grid lines.">](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-auto)

```js
Plot.plot({
  inset: 10,
  marks: [
    Plot.frame({fill: "#eaeaea"}),
    Plot.gridY({stroke: "#fff", strokeOpacity: 1}),
    Plot.gridX({stroke: "#fff", strokeOpacity: 1}),
    Plot.line(aapl, {x: "Date", y: "Close"})
  ]
})
```

The *x* and *y* axes are now automatically repeated in empty facets, improving readability by reducing eye travel to read tick values. Below, note that the *x* axis for culmen depth (with ticks at 15 and 20 mm) is rendered below the Adelie/null-sex facet in the top-right.

[<img src="./img/facet-axes.webp" width="640" alt="A scatterplot showing the culmen length and depth of various penguins, faceted by species and sex; the facets are arranged in a grid, with the y-axis on the left and the x-axis on the bottom.">](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-axes)

```js
Plot.plot({
  facet: {marginRight: 80},
  marks: [
    Plot.dot(penguins, {x: "culmen_depth_mm", y: "culmen_length_mm", stroke: "#ddd"}),
    Plot.frame(),
    Plot.gridX(),
    Plot.gridY(),
    Plot.dot(penguins, {x: "culmen_depth_mm", y: "culmen_length_mm", fx: "sex", fy: "species"})
  ]
})
```

See [Plot: Axes](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-axes) for more examples, including the new _both_ **axis** option to repeat axes on both sides of the plot, dashed grid lines via the **strokeDasharray** option, data-driven tick placement, and layering axes to show hierarchical time intervals (years, months, weeks).

Marks can now declare default margins via the **marginTop**, **marginRight**, **marginBottom**, and **marginLeft** options, and the **margin** shorthand. For each side, the maximum corresponding margin across marks becomes the plot‚Äôs default. While most marks default to zero margins (because they are drawn inside the chart area), Plot‚Äòs axis mark provides default margins depending on their anchor. The facet margin options (*e.g.*, facet.**marginRight**) now correctly affect the positioning of the *x* and *y* axis labels.

The new [*mark*.**facetAnchor**](#facetanchor) mark option controls the facets in which the mark will appear when faceting. It defaults to null for all marks except for axis marks, where it defaults to *top-empty* if the axis anchor is *top*, *right-empty* if anchor is *right*, *bottom-empty* if anchor is *bottom*, and *left-empty* if anchor is *left*. This ensures the proper positioning of the axes with respect to empty facets.

The [frame mark](./README.md#frame)‚Äôs new **anchor** option allows you to draw a line on one side of the frame (as opposed to the default behavior where a rect is drawn around all four sides); this feature is now used by the *scale*.**line** option for *x* and *y* scales. The [text mark](./README.md#text) now supports soft hyphens (`\xad`); lines are now eligible to break at soft hyphens, in which case a hyphen (-) will appear at the end of the line before the break. The [raster mark](./README.md#raster) no longer crashes with an _identity_ color scale. The [voronoi mark](./README.md#plotvoronoidata-options) now correctly respects the **target**, **mixBlendMode**, and **opacity** options.

## 0.6.2

[Released January 18, 2023.](https://github.com/observablehq/plot/releases/tag/v0.6.2)

The new [raster mark](./README.md#raster) and [contour mark](./README.md#contour) generate a raster image and smooth contours, respectively, from spatial samples. For example, the plot below shows a gridded digital elevation model of Maungawhau (R‚Äôs [`volcano` dataset](./test/data/volcano.json)) with contours every 10 meters:

[<img src="./img/volcano.webp" width="640" alt="A heatmap of Maungawhau‚Äôs topography, showing the circular caldera and surrounding slopes">](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-raster)

```js
Plot.plot({
  color: {legend: true, label: "Height (m)"},
  marks: [
    Plot.raster(volcano.values, {width: volcano.width, height: volcano.height}),
    Plot.contour(volcano.values, {width: volcano.width, height: volcano.height, interval: 10})
  ]
})
```

For non-gridded or sparse data, the raster and contour marks implement a variety of [spatial interpolation methods](./README.md#spatial-interpolation) to populate the raster grid. The *barycentric* interpolation method, shown below with data from the [Great Britain aeromagnetic survey](https://www.bgs.ac.uk/datasets/gb-aeromagnetic-survey/), uses barycentric coordinates from a Delaunay triangulation of the samples (small black dots).

[<img src="./img/ca55.webp" width="650" alt="A map showing the varying intensity of the magnetic field as periodically observed from an airplane flying in an approximate grid pattern">](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-raster)

```js
Plot.plot({
  width: 640,
  height: 484,
  inset: 4,
  x: {tickFormat: "s"},
  y: {tickFormat: "s", ticks: 5},
  color: {type: "diverging", legend: true},
  marks: [
    Plot.raster(ca55, {x: "LONGITUDE", y: "LATITUDE", fill: "MAG_IGRF90", interpolate: "barycentric"}),
    Plot.dot(ca55, {x: "LONGITUDE", y: "LATITUDE", r: 0.75, fill: "currentColor"})
  ]
})
```

The same data, with a smidge of blur, as filled contours in projected coordinates:

[<img src="./img/ca55-contours.webp" width="650" alt="A map showing the varying intensity of the magnetic field as periodically observed from an airplane flying in an approximate grid pattern">](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-contour)

```js
Plot.plot({
  width: 640,
  height: 484,
  color: {type: "diverging", legend: true},
  projection: {type: "reflect-y", domain: {type: "MultiPoint", coordinates: ca55.map((d) => [d.GRID_EAST, d.GRID_NORTH])}},
  marks: [Plot.contour(ca55, {x: "GRID_EAST", y: "GRID_NORTH", fill: "MAG_IGRF90", stroke: "currentColor", blur: 2})]
})
```

Naturally, the raster and contour mark are compatible with Plot‚Äôs [projection system](./README.md#projection-options), allowing spatial samples to be shown in any geographic projection and in conjunction with other geographic data. The *equirectangular* projection is the natural choice for this gridded global water vapor dataset from [NASA Earth Observations](https://neo.gsfc.nasa.gov/view.php?datasetId=MYDAL2_M_SKY_WV&date=2022-11-01).

[<img src="./img/water-vapor.png" width="650" alt="A map of global atmospheric water vapor, showing a higher concentration of water vapor near the equator">](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-raster)

```js
Plot.plot({
  projection: "equirectangular",
  color: {
    scheme: "ylgnbu",
    unknown: "#ccc",
    legend: true,
    label: "Water vapor (cm)"
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.raster(vapor, {
      x1: -180,
      y1: 90,
      x2: 180,
      y2: -90,
      width: 720,
      height: 360
    }),
    Plot.graticule(),
    Plot.frame()
  ]
})
```

The raster and contour mark also support sampling continuous spatial functions *f*(*x*, *y*). For example, here is the famous Mandelbrot set, with color encoding the number of iterations before the point escapes:

[<img src="./img/mandelbrot.webp" width="640" alt="The Mandelbrot set">](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-raster)

```js
Plot.plot({
  height: 500,
  marks: [
    Plot.raster({
      fill: (x, y) => {

The [vector mark](./README.md#vector) now supports the **shape** constant option; the built-in shapes are *arrow* (default) and *spike*. A custom shape can also be implemented, returning the corresponding SVG path data for the desired shape. The new [spike convenience constructor](./README.md#plotspikedata-options) creates a vector suitable for spike maps. The vector mark also now supports an **r** constant option to set the shape radius.

```js
Plot.plot({
  width: 960,
  height: 600,
  projection: "albers-usa",
  length: {
    range: [0, 200]
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.geo(nation, {fill: "#e0e0e0"}),
    Plot.geo(statemesh, {stroke: "white"}),
    Plot.spike(counties.features, Plot.geoCentroid({stroke: "red", length: (d) => population.get(d.id)}))
  ]
});
```

The new [geoCentroid transform](./README.md#plotgeocentroidoptions) and [centroid initializer](./README.md#plotcentroidoptions) compute the spherical and projected planar centroids of geometry, respectively. The new [identity](./README.md#plotidentity) channel helper returns a source array as-is, avoiding an extra copy.

The **interval** option now supports named time intervals such as ‚Äúsunday‚Äù and ‚Äúhour‚Äù, equivalent to the corresponding d3-time interval (_e.g._, d3.utcSunday and d3.utcHour). The [bin transform](./README.md#bin) is now many times faster, especially when there are many bins and when binning temporal data.

Diverging scales now correctly handle descending domains. When the stack **order** option is used without a *z* channel, a helpful error message is now thrown. The **clip** option *frame* now correctly handles band scales. Using D3 7.8, generated SVG path data is now rounded to three decimal points to reduce output size. Fix a crash when a facet scale‚Äôs domain includes a value for which there is no corresponding facet data. The bin, group, and hexbin transforms now correctly ignore undefined outputs. Upgrade D3 to 7.8.2.
